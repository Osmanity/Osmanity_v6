# Perfume E-Commerce Web App

## The Client

### Who is the client and what is their background?

The client is BlueAngle, a perfume company. They specialize in creating and selling fragrances, focusing on providing a unique experience to their customers.

### What specific vision or goal does the client have for their project?

BlueAngle aims to establish a high-functioning and aesthetically pleasing e-commerce platform, similar to the caliber of Shopify stores. They want a seamless shopping experience for their customers with a robust backend for content management.

### Are there any specific elements, principles, or values the client wants to incorporate into their project?

BlueAngle values a sophisticated, user-friendly interface and seamless integration of the store with a custom admin dashboard. They prioritize beautiful product mockups and secure transaction processing.

## The Challenge

### What are the main challenges or obstacles faced in the project?

A significant challenge was establishing efficient communication between the store and the custom admin dashboard. The complexity of creating two different apps that communicate through Axios requests was a technical hurdle.

### How do these challenges impact the overall project goals?

These challenges directly affect the project's goal to provide a seamless user experience. Difficulty in integrating the two systems could potentially disrupt the smooth operation of the e-commerce platform and backend management.

### What specific aspects of the project are most affected by these challenges?

The aspects most affected include the consistency of user experience between the store and admin panel, the real-time update and management of content, and ensuring the reliability of transactions and data exchange.

## The Solution

### What strategies or solutions were implemented to overcome the challenges?

To bridge the gap between the store and admin dashboard, robust APIs were developed using Axios for HTTP requests. Cloudinary was utilized for image upload and management, Prisma ORM with a MySQL database for data storage, Stripe for secure payment processing, and Clerk for user authentication.

### How were the solutions tailored to meet the project's specific needs and goals?

These solutions were customized to fit the project's vision of a Shopify-like e-commerce store. The use of Midjourney for mockup images enhanced the visual appeal of the products, while the rest of the tech stack ensured that the store functioned efficiently and securely.

### What was the impact of these solutions on the overall project?

The implementation of these technologies allowed BlueAngle to launch a visually stunning and functionally advanced e-commerce store and admin dashboard. The platform now delivers an exceptional shopping experience for customers and an efficient content management system for the administrators.
